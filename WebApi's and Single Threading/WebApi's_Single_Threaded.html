    <title>Web Api's and Single threaded</title>
</head>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Js is single threaded -> This means that at any
            given point point in time , that single js thread is running at most one line of js code
        </li>
        <li>
            considering the above situation we may be hault at a particluar scenario looking for some actions to get out of it we make use of asynchronous js Callbacks,promises
        </li>
        <li>
            the above code will stuck the execution as JS is single threaded but it's not the case - The broser does the Work
        </li>
        <li>
            Browser is not written in JS it is written by some other languages such as C/C++ which can handle such scenarios
        </li>
        <li>
            Browser comes with web APi's that are able to handle certain tasks in the background
            ex- setTimout(),setInterval() are such web Api's
        </li>
        <li>
            the Js call stack recongnises these web Api's functions and passes then off to the browser to take care of
        </li>
        <li>
            the browser finishes those tasks they return and are pushed onto the stack as a callback
        </li>
    </ul>
